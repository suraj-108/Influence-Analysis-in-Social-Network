# Influence-Analysis-in-Social-Network
Finding the most influential users in a Social Network and Analysing the Information Diffusion in a Network.

A group of people and a set of links among them construct a social network. The definition of
a social network could be dated back to the late 1800s when both Emile Durkheim and
Ferdinand Tonnies foresaw the phenomena of social groups. The researchers in the fields of
psychology, anthropology and mathematics work independently for the developments of
social networks. Social networking is used widely as an important communication media with
exponential growth. Specifically, Web 2.0 technology has brought revolutionary changes to
our daily lives in online social networks. In the last decade, lots of online social networks,
such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, have emerged and tightly connected web users all
over the world. People can directly engage in these networks, then build their own friendship
networks, and share their opinions, insights, information, experiences, and perspectives with
each other. In addition, they can dis-cover and spread information by using various formats
such as words, pictures, audio, and video.
Social influence analysis is pervasive throughout society. The high-level goal of social
influence analysis is to answer questions related to social influence, such as “Who can be
influenced?” “Who can influence whom?” “Who are vulnerable to influence?” “Why is a user
attracted to a particular group?” and “Who are the most influential users in a specific social
network?” The main idea of social influence analysis is how to quantify the influence of each
user and how to identify the most influential users in social net-works. It has great potential to
help us understand the ways in which information, experiences, ideas, and innovations
propagate across social networks. Analyzing and mining social networks can provide new
insights into how people interact with and influence each other, and why their ideas and
opinions on different subjects can spread in social networks.
Analysis and modeling on social influence is becoming an important part of research on
social networks. By analyzing the influencing mode among users and the spreading mode of
influence, based on social networking big data, the following advantages can be obtained:
under-standing of social behaviors of people from the angle of sociology, a theoretical basis
for making public decisions and public opinion guidance, and promoting communication and
dissemination of political, economic, and cultural activities, as well as in other fields. Thus,
social influence analysis in social networks has important social significance and application
value using social networking big data.
In this paper, we survey the research on social influence analysis with a focus on the
computational aspects and develop methods for analyzing social influence over large-scale
social networks to understand the concept of “influence” in social networks and to identify
influence groups of same interest by only targeting the seed nodes.
